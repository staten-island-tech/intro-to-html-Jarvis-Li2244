    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>by Jarvis Li</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am Jarvis Li, and this is my journey to become the greatest Game Pigeon player in the world. My nemesis, Vinson Chen.
        <br>...
        <br>Although he isn't actually that good, so... this will be easy. For now, I'll focus on...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mini Golf</li>
        <li>Gomoku</li>
        <li>Paintball</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Plan</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class = "first">First, I'll raise my stats by playing against myself. I'll play Paintball with one hand, and Gomoku with the other while I study angles, trajectory, and power in Mini golf</li>
        <li class = "first" id = "second">Then, I'll flaunt them in his face to lower his moral. I'll show him a prerecorded game in which I perform the best while he'll be thinking I'm currently playing. If I spend 23.9 seconds, he won't suspect that I'm cheating and therefore believe that I am unmatched.</li>
        <li>Next, I'll study his games while disguised as others to reach different situations at different times in each game to record every possibility. I'll psychologically profile him and use it against him.</li>
        <li>Finally, I'll destroy him and his whole career.</li>
    </ol>
